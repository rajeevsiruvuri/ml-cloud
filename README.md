# ML + Cloud Journey 🚀

Welcome to my journey of becoming an AI/ML Engineer with deep cloud and data engineering skills. I'm committed to building one project at a time, learning in public, and working harder than anyone else at this stage of my life.

### 💡 Why this exists
After rediscovering my drive, I’ve committed to becoming the best version of myself. This repo is my story in code—where I’ll document my growth and showcase real, production-ready projects.
